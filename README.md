## ABSTRACT
High frequency trading and Limit Order Book analysis have always garnered strong interests from both academic community and industry practitioners.  With recent advancements in machine learning, especially in Deep Neural Networks, more advanced models have been proposed to predict market movements based on the big data generated by Limit Order Book trading engine on worldwide exchanges. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of China stock market at the tick-level, consisting of [2270] stocks, [a few hundred billion] order and trade messages, covering the period of June to September 2020. We are interested in analyzing the data to solve an important and practical problem -- to predict the short-term market movements. Therefore, we have designed benchmark experiments for researchers to compare their model performance: at the end of each second, to forecast the upcoming trade volume and volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over 12 horizons ranging from 1 second to 300 seconds. Results based on linear, nonlinear regression models are provided and results from standard neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network are also compared. Practical trading strategy framework based on the alpha signal generated is presented.
